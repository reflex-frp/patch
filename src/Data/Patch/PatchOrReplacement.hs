-- | Either a patch or a replacement value.

-- A good patch type will describe small changes very efficiently, but
-- that often comes at the cost of describing large change rather
-- inefficiently. 'PatchOrReplacement' can be used as an escape hatch:
-- when the change as a patch would be too big, just provide a new value
-- to replace the old one with instead.
