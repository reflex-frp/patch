# Revision history for patch

## Unreleased

* Improve asympotics of merging

## 0.0.5.1 - 2021-12-28

* New dep of `base-orphans` for old GHC to get instances honestly instead of
  via `monoidal-containers`.

## 0.0.5.0 - 2021-12-17

* `Additive` now lives in `Data.Semigroup.Additive`, but is still reexported
  from `Data.Patch` for compatability.

* Rewrite `PatchMapWithMove` in terms of `PatchMapWithPatchingMove`.
  Care is taken to make this not a breaking change.
  In particular, `PatchMapWithMove` is a newtype of `PatchMapWithPatchingMove`, as is the `NodeInfo` and `From` of `PatchMapWithPatchingMove`'s versions of those.
  There are complete constructor and field patterns too, and everything is
  exported under the newtype as real constructors and fields would be.
